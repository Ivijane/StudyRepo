This is part of my "Automated System for Checking Management Tasks" study project where the registration menu is implemented. The full version of the project is used by my university.

The essence of the project is the development of a client-server application for interacting with a relational database.

With this console application, students can practice solving management tasks. After completing the test, students and professors can track the result in points. For unsolved problems, an explanation and a solution will be displayed so that students can understand where they made a mistake.

Versions updated.

Used technologies: C++, postgreSQL, Docker.
